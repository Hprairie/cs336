# CS336: Language Modeling from Scratch


This is my personal repo for working through Stanford's CS336. I watching the lectures and implementing all assignmenets on my own. I doing everything with just a 4060 (8GB VRAM), 16GB of RAM, and an AMD Ryzen 9 (16 Cores). The OS I am using is Arch.


Most assignments have a compute costly / compute minimal costs. Everything is implemented for both setups, however, I will only be training langauge models on small datasets.
