# CS336: Language Modeling from Scratch


This is my personal repo for working through Stanford's CS336. I watching the lectures and implementing all assignmenets on my own. I doing everything with just a 4060 (8GB VRAM), 16GB of RAM, and an AMD Ryzen 9 (16 Cores). The OS I am using is Arch.


Most assignments have a compute costly / compute minimal costs. Everything is implemented for both setups, however, I will only be training langauge models on small datasets.


### TODO:

I am skipping major experiments for now as it takes to long on a laptop. I.e. 1.7

- [x] Assignment 1: Building a Transformer LM  // Marking as done for now as experiments not really feasible
    - [x] Part 1: Traing BPE
    - [x] Part 2: Tokenizer
    - [x] Part 3: Language Model
    - [x] Part 4: Training Requirements
    - [x] Part 5: Training Loop
    - [x] Part 6: Generating Text
    - [ ] Part 7: Experiments
